<h3 class="red">Dominguez Rancho Adobe Museum</h3>

The Adobe contacted the Los Angeles Model Railroad Society in 2022 to determine if we could restore their 1910 Los Angeles Airfield diorama. The open-top diorama was installed in the 1970s and had not been cleaned since then. Having expertise in working on small scale, delicate layouts, we agreed to take on the project. Below are before and after photos.

<h3 class="red">The World’s Greatest Hobby Show</h3>

The Los Angeles Model Railroad Society has supported this event with a booth where club members inform and educate the public about the hobby of model railroading. The “World's Greatest Hobby on Tour” is a travelling show promoting the hobby of model railroading.
The purpose of the show is to introduce the general public to model railroading in an entertaining, lively and family-friendly atmosphere. The hobby of model railroading brings the family together in activities that teach multiple skills. Model railroad skills include carpentry, electrical engineering, historical research and scenic artistry.
