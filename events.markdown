<strong>GOLDEN SPIKE MILESTONE!</strong>

<p>
Today, the Los Angeles Model Railroad Society reached an important milestone. The final section of the mainline was completed and tested. Although we still have lots to do, today was the culmination of two years work at our new location in Harbor City.<br>
There is still a lot to do, and we are looking for people who would like to help us complete this incredible project. It's a rare opportunity to create a new layout. Bring your skills to this endeavor, or come to learn some new ones.
