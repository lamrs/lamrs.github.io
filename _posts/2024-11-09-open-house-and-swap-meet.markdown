On <strong>November 9th</strong> we will be having an Open House (10am-4pm) & Swap Meet (10am-3pm)

The Los Angeles Model Railroad Society (LAMRS) will host an Open House & Swap Meet at our new location in Harbor City.

This Swap Meet is not to be missed! We have received numerous donations of new (many in the original boxes) and lightly used HO locomotives, passenger cars and rolling stock. They are ready for a new home.
